As a senior developer, I would like to clarify that without the original code from `auth.service.ts`, I cannot provide a complete and correct code that includes the patch. The patch provided is meant to be applied to an existing codebase, and without the original code, it's impossible to integrate the patch correctly.

However, I can explain how the patch would be applied if the original code were available:

1. The patch adds an import statement for `ValidationException` from `'src/exceptions/validation.exception'`.
2. It modifies the `signUpExampleAuth` method within the `OAuthService` class.
3. The patch adds error handling logic to catch instances of `ValidationException` and handle them by creating a response payload that contains the validation errors.
4. It also adds handling for errors where the detail message includes 'already exists', which throws a `BadRequestException` with a translated message indicating that the user already exists.
5. For other errors, it throws a `BadRequestException` with a translated message indicating that something went wrong.

To apply this patch, you would typically use the `git apply` command or a similar tool within your version control system. If you can provide the original `auth.service.ts` file, I can then integrate the patch and provide you with the complete and correct code ready for production use.
